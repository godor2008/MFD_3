You may download these files and use them to order boards with SMT asssembly at https://jlcpcb.com/

Buttons you have to solder yourself.

Button used is 6*6 tactile switch with built-in LED. For example I used this https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32947533283.html
But you may find other similar buttons at alibaba.com or your local shop.
You may also add simple keycaps, for example I used this https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32918071718.html

Firmware is developed by FreeJoy https://github.com/FreeJoy-Team/FreeJoyWiki
Take a look at that project. 

Firmware may be downloaded here https://github.com/godor2008/MFD_3/blob/master/MFD/Firmware/FreeJoy_v1_6_2b3.hex

This is configuration file that contains mappings between physical and logical buttons. Should be uploaded through FreeJoy configurator after programming firmware.
